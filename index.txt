About Me

Hi, I'm Stefan! Currently I'm BackPack, an AI companion app that's a combination of Character.ai and Perplexity.

I've been in the tech space since late 2017 when I started working in crypto. In 2020, I cofounded and led the development of RAI which is a stablecoin managed by a PI (proportional integral) controller. At its peak, the RAI protocol had more than $390 million in user funds.

I was also one of the main contributors to Astroport which used to be one of the largest decentralized exchanges in the world (average daily volume of $300 million, user funds peaked at $1.7 billion).

Prior to RAI and Astroport, I used to dive into Ethereum scaling solutions and build infrastructure that connects traditional finance to DeFi. 
In another life, I was a mobile app developer.
