About Me

Hi, I'm Stefan! I've been in the crypto space since late 2017 when I started falling in love with Ethereum. 
Since then, I cofounded and led the development of RAI which is a crypto stable asset managed by a PID controller. 
I was also one of the main contributors for Astroport which used to be one of the largest decentralized exchanges in the world (average daily volume of $300M, peaked at $1.5B+).

Prior to starting my own startup, I used to dive into Ethereum scaling solutions and build infrastructure that connects traditional finance to DeFi. 
In another life, I was a mobile app developer.
