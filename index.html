  <p>I currently live in London and build my second startup in the consumer space. I grew up in Romania and previously worked in the crypto space.</p>

  <p>Things I'm interested in:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice AI.</strong> I optimize and run speech to speech pipelines. An example of what I've been playing with is <a href="https://x.com/dr__stoney/status/2010501833089859599">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumer apps.</strong> I'm mostly interested in building consumer apps and marketplaces. The prospect of serving a billion people is exciting!</li>
    <li><strong>Books.</strong> Favorite reads are Poor Charlie's Almanack, The Beginning of Infinity, Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned. Reach out if you'd like to debate any of them.</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution hacks.</strong> I infiltrated 40 student buildings and took notes about how and where to place ads and get users quickly for any app I build. It's surprisingly effective and as far as I know, no one else is doing this in London.</li>
    <li><strong>Anime.</strong> Dr Stone's my favorite anime but you probably already figured it out :)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Past Projects</h2>
  <p>A few years ago I built RAI, a modified version of the DAI stablecoin. It used an on-chain proportional integral controller to stabilize itself. The project scaled to almost $400M in AUM at the peak tho it never got real traction.</p>
  <p>I was also project lead at Astroport, a Cosmos based DEX.</p>
